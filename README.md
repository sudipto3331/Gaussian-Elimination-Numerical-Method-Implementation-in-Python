# Gaussian-Elimination-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Gaussian Elimination method for solving systems of linear equations. The code reads coefficients from an Excel file (`read.xls`), performs Gaussian Elimination to transform the system into an upper triangular matrix, and then back-substitutes to find the solution.
